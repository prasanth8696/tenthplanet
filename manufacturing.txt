   it is a document that contain how many quantity of each components required to deliver the finished product...

   * you can create multiple bom for one product


   * you can create bom for each product varients.... use this feature go to inventory and >>>> config >>> settings >>>>enable  variants

   * semi finished products :
      it is a manufatured product used in another product bill of materials to reduce complex bom structure...

   * PRODUCT =>>> TOP LEVEL PRODUCT , first create the semi finished product and add in top level product BOM...
   
   * kit =>>> doubt  
  
   * trigger automatic manufacturing for semi finshed product in two ways...
      1) recording rules(recomended) like in purchase
         set min and max quantity equal to zero(0) therefore whenever top level product  manufaturing order is posted semi finished mo also posted
         NOTE : semi finished product must be finished before manufacturing can begin on the top-level product.


      2)
